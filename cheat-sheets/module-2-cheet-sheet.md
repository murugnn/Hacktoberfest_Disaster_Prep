# Module 2: Natural & Man-Made Disasters – Quick Reference Cheat Sheet

## 🌋 Overview
Explains major types of disasters — both natural (geological, hydro-meteorological, biological) and human-induced (industrial, nuclear, transportation). Focuses on their causes, impacts, and preventive/mitigation strategies for effective disaster management.

## ⭐ Key Topics (High Frequency)
- **Geological Disasters:** Earthquakes, Volcanoes, Landslides  
- **Hydro-Meteorological Disasters:** Floods, Droughts, Cyclones  
- **Biological Disasters:** Epidemics, Pandemics  
- **Man-Made Disasters:** Industrial, Chemical, Nuclear, Transportation  
- **Disaster Impacts & Mitigation Strategies**  
- **Case Studies:** Bhopal Gas Tragedy, Chernobyl, Kerala Floods

## 📘 Important Definitions
| **Term** | **Definition** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Earthquake** | Sudden and violent shaking of the Earth's crust due to movement of tectonic plates along fault lines, releasing energy in seismic waves. |
| **Tsunami** | A series of large sea waves caused by underwater earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides displacing ocean water. |
| **Volcano** | An opening in the Earth's crust that allows molten rock (magma), gases, and ash to escape to the surface, forming volcanic landforms. |
| **Flood** | Overflow of water beyond normal confines of a river, lake, or sea, submerging normally dry land, often due to heavy rainfall or poor drainage. |
| **Drought** | A prolonged period of deficient rainfall leading to water scarcity, crop failure, and environmental stress. |
| **Epidemic** | Rapid outbreak of an infectious disease affecting a large number of people within a specific region or population. |
| **Industrial Disaster** | Accidental release of hazardous chemicals, gases, or radiation from industrial operations, causing large-scale human and environmental harm. |
| **Nuclear Disaster** | Release of radioactive materials due to reactor failure, explosion, or improper handling, leading to long-term ecological and health hazards. |

## 🧭 Exam Essentials
- **Earthquakes:** Causes (plate tectonics), Effects (ground shaking, tsunamis), Mitigation (seismic zoning, earthquake-resistant design).  
- **Floods:** Causes (rainfall, poor drainage), Effects (property loss, water-borne diseases), Mitigation (embankments, floodplain zoning).  
- **Droughts:** Causes (rainfall deficit, deforestation), Effects (crop failure, migration), Mitigation (rainwater harvesting, watershed management).  
- **Cyclones:** Low-pressure systems over oceans causing high winds and heavy rain; mitigation via early warning systems and coastal shelters.  
- **Man-Made Disasters:**  
  - *Industrial:* Bhopal Gas Tragedy (1984 – Methyl Isocyanate leak).  
  - *Nuclear:* Chernobyl (1986 – Reactor explosion in Ukraine).  
  - *Transportation:* Oil spills, train collisions, aviation accidents.

## 🧠 Memory Aids
- **Disaster Types:** *G-H-B-M* → Geological • Hydro-Meteorological • Biological • Man-made.  
- **Volcanic Layers:** *M-L-C* → Magma • Lava • Crust.  
- **Earthquake Scales:** *Richter → Magnitude*, *Mercalli → Intensity*.  
- **Flood Mitigation:** *D-R-A-I-N* → Dams • Reservoirs • Afforestation • Infrastructure • Networks (drainage).

## ⚡ Quick Facts
- **Richter Scale:** Measures earthquake magnitude (logarithmic).  
- **Chernobyl Disaster (1986):** Level 7 nuclear event; radioactive contamination spread across Europe.  
- **Bhopal Gas Tragedy (1984):** MIC gas leak from Union Carbide; >3,000 deaths.  
- **Kerala Flood (2018):** >400 deaths, heavy monsoon rainfall, massive landslides.  
- **Drought-Prone States:** Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka.  
- **Cyclone Shelters:** Built under NDMA and IMD guidance along coastal India.
