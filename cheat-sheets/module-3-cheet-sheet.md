## 📘 Important Definitions
| **Term** | **Definition** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Preparedness** | The state of readiness to effectively anticipate, respond to, and recover from potential disasters through planning, training, and resource allocation. |
| **Mitigation** | Sustained actions and measures designed to minimize or eliminate the long-term risk and impact of hazards on people, property, and the environment. |
| **Structural Measures** | Physical or engineering interventions such as flood embankments, cyclone shelters, or retrofitted buildings aimed at reducing disaster impact. |
| **Non-Structural Measures** | Policy reforms, public awareness programs, legal frameworks, land-use planning, and educational initiatives that lower disaster risks without physical construction. |
| **Capacity Building** | A continuous process that enhances the abilities, skills, infrastructure, and resources of individuals and organizations to effectively manage and reduce disaster risks. |
| **Community-Based Disaster Management (CBDM)** | An approach where local communities actively participate in identifying risks, planning, and implementing disaster risk reduction activities, ensuring ownership and sustainability. |

## 🧭 Exam Essentials
- **Preparedness vs Mitigation:** Preparedness = readiness before hazard; Mitigation = reduction of impact.  
- **Structural Examples:** Dams, levees, earthquake-resistant buildings, cyclone shelters.  
- **Non-Structural Examples:** Land zoning, awareness campaigns, mock drills, insurance, early warning systems.  
- **Community Role:** Local participation ensures sustainability, faster response, and effective recovery.  
- **Capacity Building:** Training volunteers, developing local leadership, resource mapping.
