# Module 1: Disaster Management – Quick Reference Cheat Sheet

## 🌎 Overview
Introduces the fundamentals of disaster management and Earth’s physical systems—lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere—along with the key terms used in Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Disaster Risk Management (DRM). Focuses on how natural processes interact with human activity to create or mitigate disasters.

## ⭐ Key Topics (High Frequency)
- **Disaster Management:** Concept, scope, natural vs man-made disasters  
- **Earth Systems:**  
  - *Lithosphere* – structure, rocks, soils, tectonic plates  
  - *Atmosphere* – layers, ozone layer, greenhouse effect, cyclones, monsoon  
  - *Hydrosphere* – oceans, sea ice, inland water, hydrological cycle  
  - *Biosphere* – terrestrial & aquatic ecosystems, interdependence  
- **DRR / DRM Terms:** Hazard, Exposure, Vulnerability, Risk, Capacity, Resilience, EWS, Preparedness, Prevention, Mitigation, Response, Assessment

## 📘 Important Definitions
| **Term** | **Definition** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Disaster Management** | A coordinated, multidisciplinary process aimed at preventing, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from disasters so as to minimize loss of life, property, and environment while ensuring rapid restoration of normalcy. |
| **Hazard** | A potentially damaging physical event or human activity that can cause injury, property damage, social disruption, or environmental degradation. Hazards may be natural (earthquake, cyclone) or anthropogenic (industrial accident). |
| **Exposure** | The presence of people, infrastructure, housing, or economic assets in areas that could be adversely affected by a hazard, thereby determining what is at risk. |
| **Vulnerability** | The degree to which a community or system is likely to experience harm due to its physical, social, economic, or environmental conditions that reduce its ability to withstand or cope with hazards. |
| **Risk** | The expected level of loss resulting from the interaction of a hazard with conditions of vulnerability and exposure, often expressed as *Risk = Hazard × Vulnerability × Exposure*. |
| **Capacity** | The combination of all strengths, resources, and skills available within a community or organization to anticipate, cope with, resist, and recover from hazard impacts. |
| **Resilience** | The ability of individuals, communities, and systems to absorb shocks, adapt to changing conditions, and recover quickly while maintaining essential functions and development goals. |
| **Early Warning System (EWS)** | A socio-technical framework that detects emerging hazards, assesses risk, communicates timely warnings, and ensures people understand and act effectively to reduce disaster impacts. |
| **Mitigation** | Structural and non-structural measures implemented before a disaster to reduce the severity or likelihood of hazard impacts by lowering exposure or vulnerability. |

## 🧭 Exam Essentials
- **Atmosphere Layers:** Troposphere → Stratosphere (Ozone) → Mesosphere → Thermosphere  
- **Ozone Layer:** Found ≈ 22 km high; absorbs UV radiation; depletion caused by CFCs, BFCs, and NOx.  
- **Greenhouse Effect:** Natural warming caused by GHGs (CO₂, CH₄, H₂O vapour); intensified by human emissions.  
- **Cyclones vs Anticyclones:** Low vs high pressure systems; inward vs outward spiraling winds.  
- **Indian Monsoon:** SW (June–Sept) and NE (Oct–Dec) branches—seasonal reversal of winds bringing rain.  
- **Core DRR Concepts:** Hazard • Vulnerability • Risk • Capacity • Resilience • Preparedness • Response.

## 🧠 Memory Aids
- **Atmospheric Layers:** *Throw Some Meat To Eat* → Troposphere → Stratosphere → Mesosphere → Thermosphere → Exosphere  
- **Greenhouse Gases:** *Water–Carbon–Methane* → H₂O, CO₂, CH₄  
- **SW Monsoon Branches:** *Arabian Bay* → Arabian Sea & Bay of Bengal  
- **Vulnerability Factors:** *P-S-E-E* → Physical, Social, Economic, Environmental

## ⚡ Quick Facts
- Ozone peak ≈ 22 km altitude; Ozone hole < 220 Dobson Units  
- Earth tilt = 66.5° → causes seasons  
- Oceans cover > 70 % of Earth; avg depth ≈ 3.7 km  
- Mean ocean salinity ≈ 34.7 g/kg (primarily NaCl)  
- Hydrological cycle = Evaporation → Condensation → Precipitation → Runoff → Groundwater
