![banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad5b6c78-08d4-48ac-9032-790218c8d2f6)

Welcome, 3rd-year students of NSS College of Engineering! This repository is the official home for our project, part of the GITHOBER 2.0 workshop.

The goal is simple: to collaboratively build a high-quality, open-source collection of study notes for the **Disaster Management (MCN 301)** course, making exam preparation easier and more efficient for everyone.

---

## 🎯 Our Mission

We are combining the power of AI and human collaboration to "rescue" our exam prep! In this project, each student will contribute AI-generated (and personally verified!) study notes on a specific topic from the MCN 301 syllabus. By the end, we will have a comprehensive, well-organized knowledge base for the entire course.

This repository is also a hands-on learning ground for Hacktoberfest. By contributing, you will learn the complete open-source workflow: forking, branching, committing, and creating pull requests.

## 🤔 How to Contribute

Getting started is easy! We've designed this for beginners.

1.  **Find a Topic:** Pick a topic from the MCN 301 syllabus that hasn't been covered yet. Check the `notes/` directory and the **Issues** tab to see what's available.
2.  **Generate & Verify Notes:** Use an AI tool to generate notes for your chosen topic. **Crucially, review, edit, and verify the information for accuracy.**
3.  **Add Your File:** Create a new Markdown file (`.md`) in the correct module directory.
4.  **Add Your Name:** Add your name to the contributors' table at the bottom of this README.
5.  **Submit a Pull Request:** Follow our detailed **[Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)** to submit your work.

**For a step-by-step guide with all the git commands, please read our `CONTRIBUTING.md` file!**
