# Comparative Analysis of International Disaster Management Frameworks

## Introduction

The rising frequency and complexity of disasters worldwide have spurred the development of several international frameworks aimed at reducing disaster risk and promoting resilience. This document provides a comparative analysis of key international frameworks: the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030), its predecessor—the Hyogo Framework for Action (2005-2015), the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with disaster-related targets, and the Paris Agreement—highlighting their main features, points of integration, evolution, and the example of India's alignment with these global initiatives.

## Framework Introductions

### Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030)

The Sendai Framework is the current global blueprint for disaster risk reduction (DRR), adopted by UN member states in 2015. It emphasizes a shift from disaster management to risk management, focusing on understanding and reducing disaster risk through increased preparedness, investment, and resilience-building actions[1].

### Hyogo Framework for Action (2005-2015)

Launched in 2005, the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) was the first major international strategy for DRR. Its goal was to substantially reduce disaster losses by building the resilience of nations and communities[2]. The HFA provided five priorities of action that influenced future policies globally and set the stage for its successor, the Sendai Framework.

### Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

Adopted in 2015, the SDGs are a universal set of 17 goals that guide global development efforts. Several goals directly address disaster risk, resilience, and climate adaptation, recognizing the inextricable link between development and disaster risk management, such as Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities) and Goal 13 (Climate Action)[3].

### Paris Agreement

Agreed upon in 2015 within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Paris Agreement aims to combat climate change and its effects. It explicitly acknowledges the importance of enhancing adaptive capacity and resilience to climate-induced disasters, promoting international cooperation for disaster risk reduction[4].

## Comparative Analysis Table

### Table 1: Comparison of Key International Disaster Management Frameworks

| Framework | Time Period | Focus Areas | Priorities/Goals | Target Countries |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| Sendai (2015-2030) | 2015-2030 | Disaster Risk Reduction, Resilience | 4 Priorities, 7 Global Targets | Global (UN members) |
| Hyogo (2005-2015) | 2005-2015 | Disaster Risk Reduction, Capacity Building | 5 Priorities for Action | Global (UN members) |
| SDGs | 2015-2030 | Development, Resilience, Adaptation, Equity | 17 Goals, DRR in Goals 1, 11, 13, etc. | Universal (all countries) |
| Paris Agreement | 2020 onward | Climate Change, Adaptation, Resilience | Mitigation, Adaptation, Finance | Parties to UNFCCC |

### Table 2: Implementation Mechanisms and Evolution of Frameworks

| Framework | Implementation Mechanisms | Evolution/Integration |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Sendai | National platforms, global targets, voluntary reporting, stakeholder participation | Built upon HFA, integrated DRR with SDGs and Paris Agreement |
| Hyogo | National policy guidance, five priorities, biennial progress reviews | Foundation for Sendai, introduced cross-sectoral DRR |
| SDGs | National/local adaptation of goals, indicator-based review, mainstreaming | Integrates DRR in sustainable development; aligns with Sendai and Paris |
| Paris Agreement | Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), adaptation plans, global stocktake | Links climate adaptation to DRR, references SDGs |

## Evolution from Hyogo to Sendai

The transition from the Hyogo Framework to the Sendai Framework marked a paradigm shift from merely managing disaster events to proactively reducing disaster risks. Sendai introduced:

- A broader scope, addressing all types of risks and hazards, including environmental and health emergencies.
- Four priorities, focusing on risk understanding, governance, investment, and preparedness.
- Quantifiable global targets to measure progress.
- Enhanced emphasis on science, technology, and community engagement.

These enhancements addressed gaps in the HFA, such as insufficient attention to underlying drivers of risk, and greater integration with development and climate goals[1][2].

## Integration Among Frameworks

The Sendai Framework, SDGs, and the Paris Agreement are mutually reinforcing:

- SDGs embed DRR in their targets (e.g., resilient infrastructure in Goal 9, reducing the impact of disasters in Goal 11).
- The Paris Agreement aligns adaptation strategies with DRR, recognizing the risk of climate-induced disasters.
- Sendai provides a framework for implementing disaster-related aspects of both SDGs and the Paris Agreement, promoting coherence and efficiency in global risk governance[3][4][5].

## India's Alignment with International Frameworks

India has progressively aligned its disaster management policies with international frameworks:

- Adopted the Sendai Framework principles in the National Disaster Management Plan (2016), focusing on preparedness, risk assessment, and resilient infrastructure.
- Integrated the SDGs and disaster resilience into national development schemes, e.g., Smart Cities Mission, AMRUT, and housing for all.
- Included climate adaptation (as per Paris Agreement) in sectoral plans, such as the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC).
- Established a strong institutional framework—e.g., National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM), and National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)—to operationalize global best practices at national and state levels[6][7].

## Conclusion

The landscape of international disaster management frameworks has evolved toward greater integration, quantifiable commitments, and concrete links with sustainable development and climate action. The Sendai Framework, SDGs, and Paris Agreement together set the agenda for holistic disaster risk reduction, with nations like India actively working to harmonize national priorities with global objectives for a safer, more resilient future.
