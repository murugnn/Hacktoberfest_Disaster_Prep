# Comparative Analysis of Key International Disaster-Related Frameworks

## Introduction

International disaster risk management is shaped by a set of major frameworks that together address disaster risk reduction, sustainable development, and climate change. The Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA), the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR), the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the Paris Agreement form an interlinked architecture guiding national policies and practice, including in India.

## 1. Hyogo Framework for Action (2005–2015)

The Hyogo Framework for Action 2005–2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters was adopted at the World Conference on Disaster Reduction in Kobe, Hyogo, Japan. It set the overall goal of substantially reducing disaster losses in lives and in the social, economic, and environmental assets of communities and countries.

HFA articulated five Priorities for Action:
- Ensure that disaster risk reduction (DRR) is a national and local priority with a strong institutional basis.
- Identify, assess, and monitor disaster risks and enhance early warning.
- Use knowledge, innovation, and education to build a culture of safety and resilience.
- Reduce the underlying risk factors (e.g., poor land use, environmental degradation, weak infrastructure).
- Strengthen disaster preparedness for effective response at all levels.

Implementation relied on voluntary commitments, national platforms for DRR, integration of DRR into sectoral policies, and periodic self‑assessment reports coordinated through the UN system. Monitoring was largely qualitative, using progress reviews rather than quantified global targets.

## 2. Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015–2030)

The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030 was adopted at the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Sendai, Japan, as the successor to HFA. Its goal is to substantially reduce disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods, health, and the economic, physical, social, cultural, and environmental assets of persons, businesses, communities, and countries.

Sendai introduces seven global targets (A–G), including:
- Reducing global disaster mortality.
- Reducing the number of affected people.
- Reducing direct disaster economic loss relative to global GDP.
- Reducing damage to critical infrastructure and disruption of basic services.
- Increasing the number of countries with national and local DRR strategies.
- Enhancing international cooperation to developing countries.
- Increasing access to multi‑hazard early warning systems and disaster risk information.

It is structured around four Priorities for Action:
- Understanding disaster risk.
- Strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk.
- Investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience.
- Enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response and “Build Back Better” in recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction.

Compared with Hyogo, Sendai expands hazard coverage (including technological and biological hazards), emphasizes systemic and multi‑hazard risk, and provides a more robust monitoring system with agreed indicators.

## 3. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – Disaster‑Related Goals

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in 2015, sets 17 SDGs and 169 targets as the global development framework to 2030. Disasters are recognized as a serious threat to development, and resilience is integrated across multiple goals.

Key explicitly disaster‑related targets include:
- SDG 1.5: Build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate‑related extreme events and other economic, social, and environmental shocks and disasters.
- SDG 11.5: By 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of people affected by disasters, and substantially decrease direct economic losses relative to global GDP, with a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations.
- SDG 13.1: Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate‑related hazards and natural disasters in all countries.

Other goals, such as SDG 2 (food security), SDG 3 (health), SDG 6 (water and sanitation), SDG 9 (infrastructure), SDG 14–15 (ecosystems), and SDG 16 (institutions), implicitly require risk‑informed, resilience‑oriented implementation that aligns with Sendai’s DRR priorities.

## 4. Paris Agreement – Climate–Disaster Linkage

The Paris Agreement under the UNFCCC, adopted in 2015, is the central global treaty on climate change. Its long‑term goal is to hold the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre‑industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C.

The Agreement links strongly to disaster risk through:
- A global goal on adaptation, enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience, and reducing vulnerability to climate change.
- Recognition of climate‑resilient development pathways that integrate mitigation, adaptation, and sustainable development.
- Provisions on loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including extreme events and slow‑onset processes.
- Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), adaptation communications, and finance mechanisms that can support DRR measures such as resilient infrastructure, early warning systems, and ecosystem‑based approaches.

Climate‑driven hazards (floods, storms, heatwaves, droughts, sea‑level rise) mean that effective implementation of the Paris Agreement directly influences the frequency and intensity of disasters and therefore the achievement of Sendai and disaster‑related SDG targets.

## 6. Evolution from Hyogo to Sendai

The evolution from HFA to Sendai represents a shift from building DRR programs and institutions towards a more integrated, risk‑based, and results‑oriented framework. Hyogo focused on putting DRR on national agendas, creating institutions, and promoting basic risk assessment and early warning.

Sendai:
- Introduces quantitative global targets and indicators for mortality, affected people, economic losses, and infrastructure disruption.
- Broadens hazard coverage to include technological and biological hazards and recognizes small‑scale, slow‑onset, and cascading risks.
- Emphasizes understanding risk in all its dimensions (exposure, vulnerability, capacity, and hazard characteristics) and managing systemic risk.
- Embeds “Build Back Better” as a core principle for recovery, linking reconstruction with long‑term resilience.
- Is explicitly positioned to be coherent with the SDGs and the Paris Agreement as part of the 2015 “triple agenda,” encouraging integrated national planning.

Thus, Sendai can be seen as deepening and operationalizing HFA’s principles, while aligning DRR with broader development and climate policy.

## 7. Integration Between the Frameworks

The Sendai Framework, SDGs, and Paris Agreement are designed to be mutually reinforcing:
- Sendai targets on disaster mortality, affected people, economic loss, and infrastructure damage complement SDG targets 1.5, 11.5, 13.1 and others on resilient infrastructure, health, and ecosystems.
- The Paris Agreement’s adaptation and resilience goals overlap with Sendai’s priorities on risk reduction and preparedness, especially for climate‑related hazards.
- Risk‑informed, climate‑resilient development is the common thread: investments in resilient infrastructure, early warning, ecosystem‑based approaches, and social protection simultaneously advance Sendai, SDG, and Paris objectives.

Countries are encouraged to:
- Align national DRR strategies with SDG implementation and climate plans.
- Use common risk information and data systems to serve DRR, development, and climate reporting.
- Maximize co‑benefits (e.g., coastal mangrove restoration that supports livelihoods, biodiversity, climate mitigation, and storm protection).

## 8. India’s Alignment with These Frameworks

India has progressively aligned its disaster management and climate policies with all four frameworks.

### 8.1 Alignment with Hyogo and Sendai

- The Disaster Management Act 2005 established the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), State Disaster Management Authorities, and institutional mechanisms that reflected Hyogo’s emphasis on national and local DRR structures.
- India developed the National Policy on Disaster Management and state/district plans focusing on preparedness, early warning, and response, consistent with HFA priorities.
- In the Sendai era, India adopted a revised National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP) explicitly mapped to Sendai’s four priorities and seven targets, emphasizing multi‑hazard risk assessment, mainstreaming DRR into development, and “Build Back Better.”
- India has strengthened multi‑hazard early warning systems (e.g., for cyclones in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea, flood forecasting), improved evacuation and shelter systems, and expanded community‑based DRR and capacity‑building programs.

### 8.2 Alignment with SDGs

- India has a national SDG framework with NITI Aayog coordinating implementation, and national indicators mapped to global SDG indicators, including those related to disasters (1.5, 11.5, 13.1).
- Flagship schemes such as:
  - Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (housing),
  - Smart Cities Mission,
  - Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT),
  - Jal Jeevan Mission and Swachh Bharat Mission,
  - National Health Mission,
  incorporate resilience and risk reduction elements in urban planning, housing, health, water, and sanitation.
- DRR is increasingly integrated into land‑use planning, infrastructure standards (e.g., seismic codes), and social protection, supporting both SDG and Sendai goals.

### 8.3 Alignment with the Paris Agreement

- India’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) include mitigation targets and major adaptation components in sectors such as agriculture, water, forests, coastal zones, and urban areas, many of which directly reduce climate‑related disaster risk.
- The National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) and State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCCs) promote climate‑resilient development and sector‑specific adaptation strategies.
- India co‑launched the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), which directly connects climate‑resilient infrastructure, DRR, and global cooperation, helping operationalize the link between Sendai and the Paris Agreement.
- Coastal zone management, mangrove conservation, drought management, heat‑action plans, and resilient agriculture programs show how climate adaptation and DRR are being implemented together.
