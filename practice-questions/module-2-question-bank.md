#### Question 2 (3 marks)
**Question:** List two main sources of data used in hazard mapping.

**Model Answer:**
The two fundamental sources of data for hazard mapping are base maps and remotely sensed images. Base maps are pre-existing or newly created cartographic layers that provide essential geographic information such as elevation, road networks, hydrography, infrastructure, and administrative boundaries, allowing hazard data to be accurately located over real space. Remotely sensed images, including aerial photographs and satellite imagery (from platforms like RADARSAT or GeoEye), supply up-to-date and high-resolution visual records of the Earth's surface; these images enable the detection and monitoring of hazards over large areas and time periods, which is essential for recognizing hazard patterns and changes.

**Keywords:** Cartography, elevation, spatial data, earth observation, networks.

#### Question 4 (3 marks)
**Question:** Name the four types of vulnerability assessed in disaster risk studies.

**Model Answer:**
The four primary types of vulnerability are:
1. Physical vulnerability: Relates to the susceptibility of infrastructure, buildings, and lifelines to damage during hazard events.
2. Social vulnerability: Concerns the sensitivity of people—such as children, elderly, marginalized groups—and community structures to harm due to social or cultural disadvantages.
3. Economic vulnerability: Reflects the potential for financial losses and the impact on livelihoods, industries, and economic activities.
4. Environmental (ecological) vulnerability: Encompasses the exposure and sensitivity of ecosystems, natural resources, and environmental services to hazards, often resulting in loss of biodiversity and reduced capacity for recovery.

**Keywords:** Infrastructure, community, livelihoods, ecosystems, disadvantage.

**Marking Scheme Breakdown:**
- Identifying and briefly relating all four types (3 marks)

#### Question 5 (3 marks)
**Question:** What is participatory mapping?

**Model Answer:**
Participatory mapping is a collaborative process where community members, especially those living in hazard-prone or vulnerable areas, work directly with experts to gather, record, and visualize local knowledge, risks, resources, and perspectives on maps. This process increases the accuracy and relevance of disaster planning data by including indigenous knowledge, historical experiences, and locally observed changes, which might otherwise be overlooked. Ultimately, it empowers the community, increases stakeholder buy-in, and ensures that hazard and vulnerability maps reflect actual lived realities.

**Keywords:** Collaboration, local knowledge, empowerment, relevance, disaster planning.

### **Part B: Medium Answer Questions (7 Marks Each)**

---

#### Question 6 (7 marks)
**Question:** Explain physical, social, and economic vulnerability with examples.

**Model Answer:**
Physical vulnerability refers to the susceptibility of infrastructure and physical assets, such as buildings, roads, and bridges, to damage or collapse in the face of natural hazards; for example, a community of houses built from lightweight materials in a floodplain is physically vulnerable to floods and storms, as structural failure is highly probable. Social vulnerability addresses the characteristics of people—age, health, gender, social isolation, or marginalized status—that influence how they experience disasters; for instance, the elderly or disabled individuals may find evacuation more difficult during a cyclone, increasing their risk of injury or death due to social exclusion or lack of mobility support. Economic vulnerability concerns the sensitivity of livelihoods, employment, and income sources to hazardous events; for example, a local fishing community may lose its boats and daily earnings due to a tsunami, drastically impacting household and regional economy, with virtually no buffer or insurance.

When analyzing vulnerability, it is crucial to realize that these categories often intersect: for example, low-income families living in unsafe housing not only face economic hardship but also structural risk and social exclusion.

**Keywords:** Infrastructure, marginalized, intersection, economic hardship, risk factors.

#### Question 7 (7 marks)
**Question:** Describe the procedure of hazard mapping using GIS.

**Model Answer:**
Hazard mapping with GIS (Geographic Information Systems) typically starts with the collection and digitizing of spatial data, such as base maps from official sources, satellite imagery, and field survey results that provide both geographic references and details about hazard-prone locations. Once core datasets are assembled, thematic layers are produced to represent various hazards (floods, earthquakes, landslides), vulnerable elements (settlements, schools, roads), and key environmental features (rivers, vegetation). Using GIS, data analysts overlay these layers, apply classification schemes to grade hazard intensity (high, medium, low), and annotate the probability or history of hazardous events for each area. The software also enables advanced analyses such as spatial statistics, scenario modeling, and the generation of 2D and 3D maps to visualize hazard patterns over time and space. The GIS-based hazard map outputs are then validated and updated through ground surveys and stakeholder feedback, ensuring accuracy and usability for disaster risk management.

**Keywords:** Digitizing, thematic layers, overlay, scenario modeling, validation.

#### Question 8 (7 marks)
**Question:** Outline steps in conducting a vulnerability assessment at the community level.

**Model Answer:**
1. Identification of elements at risk: Begin by cataloging all assets, people, infrastructure, and economic activities likely to be exposed to hazards.
2. Community data collection: Use surveys, interviews, and participatory mapping to gather information on dwellings, population demographics, health status, livelihoods, and local hazard history.
3. Assessment of exposure: Evaluate which groups, locations, or assets have the greatest potential for direct hazard impact; for example, poor neighborhoods built on slopes are more exposed to landslides.
4. Analysis of coping and adaptation: Examine existing local strategies and resources—social networks, early warning systems, evacuation plans—used to deal with hazards.
5. Quantitative and qualitative ranking: Assign vulnerability scores or categorize groups/areas using indices, checklists, or vulnerability matrices to facilitate comparisons.
6. Stakeholder validation and reporting: Share the preliminary findings with the community and local leaders to validate accuracy, address concerns, and finalize results for use in disaster risk reduction strategies.

This participatory approach ensures context-specific understanding and enhances the acceptance and implementation of recommendations.

#### Question 9 (7 marks)
**Question:** What are the applications of hazard maps in disaster management?

**Model Answer:**
Hazard maps have wide-ranging applications in disaster management, making them foundational for spatial planning by supporting planners in zoning land uses to keep critical facilities (such as hospitals and schools) out of high-risk zones, ensuring safer urban design. They guide the placement and design of risk reduction structures, such as levees, floodwalls, and safe shelters, facilitating smart investment decisions. Hazard maps also serve emergency planners by pinpointing neighborhoods most likely to need evacuation or special assistance, enabling focused resource allocation and logistical planning. They play a substantial role in risk communication, helping to raise public awareness and foster preparedness among residents by providing clear, readily interpretable visualizations of local risks. Moreover, hazard maps underpin long-term policy-making and development, informing building codes, insurance requirements, and continuous monitoring of risk trends.

**Keywords:** Spatial planning, targeted mitigation, emergency logistics, visualization, policy-making.

#### Question 10 (7 marks)
**Question:** Discuss qualitative and quantitative methods in risk assessment.

**Model Answer:**
Qualitative risk assessment involves categorizing hazards and risks based on descriptive criteria, such as "high," "moderate," or "low," often using simple matrices that cross-reference probability and severity; it is particularly useful when numerical data is scarce or when stakeholder perceptions need to be included. Semi-quantitative methods use risk indices—numerical values derived from criteria weights but without direct loss quantification—offering a comparative but not absolute scale of risk, often utilizing GIS for spatial risk mapping. Quantitative risk assessment, by contrast, requires more detailed data and analytical rigor, employing formulas or models to estimate likelihood, magnitude, and impact in absolute terms (e.g., expected deaths, economic loss), allowing precise scenario analysis and prioritization of mitigation options. These methods can be strategically combined for comprehensive risk planning: qualitative for initial screening, semi-quantitative for prioritized action, and quantitative analysis for policies where precise loss figures are warranted.

**Keywords:** Risk matrix, indices, probability, magnitude, scenario analysis.

**Marking Scheme Breakdown:**
- Each method described in detail (2 marks each)
- Their strategic use for different stages of planning (1 mark)

### **Part C: Long Answer Questions (14 Marks Each)**

---

#### Question 11 (14 marks)
**Question:** Describe the empirical and analytical methods for assessing physical vulnerability. Compare their strengths and limitations.

**Model Answer:**
Empirical methods for physical vulnerability assessment depend on real-world damage and loss data collected after past disasters, such as survey results documenting building damage post-earthquake or aftermath inventories from flood events. By analyzing repeat patterns across similar hazard events, these methods generate statistical relationships between hazard intensity (e.g., ground shaking level) and the extent of damage to categorized building types or infrastructure. The advantage is their grounding in observable outcomes, making them fairly reliable for established asset types and large communities. However, their reliance on extensive, high-quality historical data is a limitation, particularly in places with rare disasters or rapid changes in construction practices.

Analytical methods simulate hazard impacts on structures or assets using theoretical modeling, engineering formulas, or computer simulations. These approaches use physical laws (such as structural engineering codes or finite element modeling) to predict how buildings, bridges, or lifelines will react to specific hazard intensities (wind, shaking, flood depth), allowing for the evaluation of new construction types or retrofitting options. Analytical methods offer high precision and can be adapted for innovative designs, but require complex data inputs and specialized expertise, thus are often limited in application to smaller scales or new projects rather than large populations.

A practical comparison shows that empirical approaches are ideal for broad, community-level planning where similar building types are widespread, while analytical methods are best for engineering assessments of novel, unique, or critical facilities. Using both in tandem—e.g., empirical for baseline risk mapping and analytical for critical infrastructure—provides the most comprehensive physical vulnerability picture.

**Keywords:** Historical damage, statistical relationships, engineering modeling, precision, planning scale.

**Marking Scheme Breakdown:**

#### Question 12 (14 marks)
**Question:** Explain multi-level and multi-stakeholder approaches in disaster risk assessment and their importance in risk reduction.

**Model Answer:**
Multi-level risk assessment distinguishes and integrates risk evaluations conducted at various spatial or administrative scales: at the local (village or city), regional (district or state), and national levels. Each scale demands methods and data suited to available resources, policy objectives, and local contexts. For example, local assessments might focus on household-level vulnerabilities and coping strategies, while national-scale assessments synthesize risks across sectors to inform broad policy. This nested approach ensures interventions are appropriate for the governance scale, supporting both grassroots action and top-down policy harmonization.

Multi-stakeholder assessment brings together government agencies, non-governmental organizations, technical experts, local leaders, and community representatives to collaboratively diagnose risks and set priorities. This inclusion increases the quality and ownership of risk data (as local knowledge complements technical analysis), ensures that vulnerable voices shape policy, and produces risk management strategies that are holistic, realistic, and more likely to be accepted and sustained.

Both approaches are vital in modern disaster risk management: multi-level assessment guarantees that risks are neither overlooked at micro levels nor oversimplified by national averages, while multi-stakeholderism breaks silos, fosters innovation, and bridges the gap between expert models and on-the-ground realities, thus promoting more equitable and robust risk reduction.

**Keywords:** Nested scales, governance, inclusion, policy harmonization, holistic strategies.

**Marking Scheme Breakdown:**
- Thorough descriptions, examples for each approach (5 marks each)
- Analysis of importance and synergistic benefits (4 marks)

#### Question 13 (14 marks)
**Question:** Critically analyze the role of GIS in vulnerability and risk assessment.

**Model Answer:**
GIS (Geographic Information Systems) is a technology for capturing, storing, analyzing, and displaying geospatial data, and is an integral tool in contemporary vulnerability and risk assessment. It allows for the efficient management of vast and varied data sets, incorporating hazard zones, exposure points, demographic attributes, land use, and critical facilities on a single dynamic platform. Through spatial overlay analysis, GIS enables the identification of risk "hotspots" by revealing where hazard-prone areas coincide with vulnerable populations or assets.

Furthermore, GIS supports the modeling of multiple scenarios (e.g., varying flood depths or earthquake magnitudes), helping planners visualize probable impacts, plan evacuation routes, and prioritize mitigation investments in the most at-risk communities. The use of spatial multi-criteria evaluation within GIS enables more objective, transparent risk ranking and facilitates stakeholder discussions based on evidence.

However, effectiveness depends on data availability, accuracy, and human resource capacity: poor data quality leads to misleading outputs, while lack of trained personnel or technological infrastructure can obstruct adoption, especially in low-resource settings. Despite these limitations, the widespread use of GIS has revolutionized not only mapping but the entire disaster risk reduction process—enabling data-driven, targeted, and adaptive management of evolving risks.

**Keywords:** Spatial overlay, scenario modeling, multi-criteria, evidence-based, data limitations.

**Marking Scheme Breakdown:**

#### Question 14 (14 marks)
**Question:** Discuss the process and significance of participatory mapping for vulnerability assessment and risk reduction.

**Model Answer:**
Participatory mapping begins with the identification of mapping objectives—such as charting flood risk zones or evacuation routes—in collaboration with community stakeholders. Next, facilitators, often in the form of NGOs or local government, organize planning sessions where residents share knowledge, sketch community maps, and identify “at-risk” locations (homes, wells, fields). This is followed by fieldwork, where community and technical teams survey the area, document hazard impacts and resource distribution, and validate findings on the ground. The information is then consolidated—by producing paper or digital maps—presented for feedback, and refined collectively until agreement is reached.

The significance of this process lies in its capacity to bridge the gap between technical assessments and lived reality. It leverages local and indigenous knowledge (e.g., historical flood markers, spontaneous coping strategies, seasonal migration patterns) that is often invisible in top-down data. Participatory mapping fosters ownership over disaster plans, builds trust and communication among community members, authorities, and experts, and increases the legitimacy and sustainability of risk reduction measures. It also empowers marginalized groups to articulate their vulnerabilities and needs, ensuring inclusiveness in disaster management.

Ultimately, participatory mapping improves both the technical quality and the acceptance of vulnerability assessments, thereby facilitating the adoption of practical, locally adapted, and sustainable risk reduction strategies.

**Keywords:** Collaboration, field validation, indigenous knowledge, empowerment, inclusivity.

**Marking Scheme Breakdown:**
- Clear, well-elaborated participatory mapping process (7 marks)
- Detailed significance, with emphasis on empowerment, inclusivity, and technical benefits (7 marks)

#### Question 15 (14 marks)
**Question:** Explain how vulnerability indices and curves are used in quantifying and visualizing disaster risk.

**Model Answer:**
Vulnerability indices are composite measures generated by integrating a range of social, economic, physical, and environmental indicators (e.g., poverty rate, housing quality, access to healthcare, ecosystem sensitivity), often using weighted scoring systems to assign each community or unit a single numerical score reflecting its overall susceptibility to hazards. These indices allow planners to rank and compare risk levels between different neighborhoods, regions, or population groups, thereby identifying priorities for intervention and monitoring progress in reducing vulnerability over time.

Vulnerability curves, by contrast, are graphical representations that plot the relationship between hazard intensity (such as wind speed or flood depth) and resulting loss or damage. There are three prominent types:
- Relative curves: Show the percentage of asset value lost at increasing hazard levels.
- Absolute curves: Depict actual quantities of loss (e.g., total monetary value or number of homes damaged).
- Fragility curves: Indicate the probability of reaching or exceeding a particular damage state under given hazard intensities.

These curves, developed from empirical or analytical data, help visualize how risk escalates as hazards intensify, guide the definition of safety thresholds, and support scenario analysis (e.g., what if rainfall intensity increases by 20%?). By combining indices and curves, decision-makers can both see overall vulnerability patterns and understand specific risk thresholds, enhancing the design of targeted, evidence-based mitigation and adaptation strategies.

**Keywords:** Weighted indicators, empirical data, scenario analysis, prioritization, thresholds.
