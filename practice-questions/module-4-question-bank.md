## **Part C: Long Answer Questions (14 Marks Each)**

### Question 11 (14 marks)

**Question:** Describe in detail the six steps of crisis counselling and explain their significance in disaster response.

**Model Answer:** Crisis counselling follows a systematic six-step process crucial for effective disaster response:

**Step One: Define the Problem** - This phase helps individuals figure out the specific problem they're trying to solve. During disasters where fear and anxiety can be overwhelming, this step focuses people on exact issues they want to address or minimize, preventing them from being paralyzed by the enormity of the situation. By breaking down complex disaster impacts into manageable problems, counsellors enable clients to begin taking constructive action.

**Step Two: Ensure Safety** - Safety is paramount throughout the entire counselling process and colors all other steps. Counsellors must emphasize that the safety of individuals, families, and communities is the overriding concern. This includes physical safety from hazards, emotional safety from trauma, and psychological safety to express feelings without judgment. When people feel safe, they can engage more fully in the recovery process.

**Step Three: Provide Support** - Counsellors communicate that they are present to assist, conveying the message "Here is one person who really cares about you." This demonstration of support has psychological benefits of reassuring the person and allowing them to enter a calmer state where they can help solve problems collaboratively. It demonstrates unconditional positive regard, which is essential for building trust during vulnerable moments.

**Step Four: Examine Alternatives** - Anxiety is the enemy of creative thinking, yet disasters require new solutions to novel problems. By helping identify alternatives, counsellors enable clear-headed thinking. This is most effective after proceeding through previous phases to get everyone in a productive mental state. Counsellors facilitate brainstorming without judgment, helping clients see possibilities they might miss while stressed.

**Step Five: Make a Plan** - After weighing alternatives, the most likely approach is decided collaboratively. Group participation in decision-making ensures that individual choices are better informed when others contribute perspectives. Thorough weighing of options usually arrives at the best conclusions, and clients feel ownership over plans they help create, increasing likelihood of implementation.

**Step Six: Obtain Commitment** - Individuals receive specific assignments, and counsellors ensure understanding by asking clients to briefly summarize plans back to them. This verification ensures appropriate nuance has been captured and that clients genuinely understand and commit to their action steps, increasing follow-through.

The significance of this structured approach lies in its ability to transform overwhelming crisis situations into manageable problems with concrete solutions. It empowers individuals to move from victim to survivor to active participant in their recovery. By providing structure when chaos reigns, it restores a sense of control and agency. Each step builds upon the previous one, creating a therapeutic progression that addresses both immediate safety needs and longer-term coping strategies. This systematic approach also allows crisis counsellors to work efficiently during disasters when many people need help simultaneously, ensuring quality care under pressure.

**Keywords:** Problem definition, safety assurance, unconditional support, alternative exploration, collaborative planning, commitment verification.

**Marking Scheme Breakdown:**
- Detailed explanation of each of six steps (10 marks)
- Discussion of significance in disaster context (4 marks)

### Question 12 (14 marks)

**Question:** Critically analyze stakeholder analysis methods (Grid method and Salience model) and explain how to plan stakeholder engagement based on analysis results.

**Model Answer:** **Stakeholder Analysis Methods:**

**Grid Method:**
The grid method uses two parameters to analyze and categorize stakeholders. The most popular is the power-interest grid, which evaluates stakeholders based on their power (ability to influence project outcomes) and interest (level of concern about project results). This creates four quadrants:
1. **High Power-High Interest**: Key players requiring close engagement and satisfaction
2. **High Power-Low Interest**: Keep satisfied but don't overwhelm with communication
3. **Low Power-High Interest**: Keep informed and engaged as advocates
4. **Low Power-Low Interest**: Monitor with minimal


**Salience Model:**
The salience model uses three parameters for more nuanced analysis:
1. **Power**: Ability to impose will despite resistance
2. **Legitimacy**: Appropriateness of stakeholder's claim or relationship
3. **Urgency**: Time-sensitivity of stakeholder's claims

Stakeholders possessing all three attributes are "definitive stakeholders" requiring immediate attention. Those with two attributes are "expectant stakeholders" (dangerous, dependent, or dominant). Those with one attribute are "latent stakeholders" (dormant, discretionary, or demanding). This model recognizes that stakeholder salience changes over time as circumstances evolve.

The salience model's strength lies in capturing complexity and dynamic nature of stakeholder relationships. However, it requires more detailed assessment and can be subjective in determining legitimacy and urgency.

**Planning Stakeholder Engagement:**

Once analysis is complete, a stakeholder engagement assessment matrix is prepared, categorizing stakeholders into five levels:
1. **Unaware**: Don't know about project or impacts
2. **Resistant**: Aware but resistant to change
3. **Neutral**: Aware but neither supportive nor resistant
4. **Supportive**: Aware and supportive of project
5. **Leading**: Aware and actively engaged in ensuring success

For each stakeholder, identify their current engagement level and desired level. Develop specific strategies to move stakeholders from current to desired positions through targeted communication, involvement in decision-making, addressing concerns, and building trust. High power-high interest stakeholders need frequent, detailed communication and active participation. Low power-high interest stakeholders can serve as advocates and should be kept well-informed. The engagement plan should be regularly monitored and adjusted based on effectiveness and changing stakeholder dynamics.

**Keywords:** Power-interest grid, salience attributes, engagement levels, dynamic relationships, targeted strategies.

**Marking Scheme Breakdown:**
- Detailed explanation of grid method with quadrants (4 marks)
- Detailed explanation of salience model with categories (4 marks)
- Engagement planning process and strategies (4 marks)
- Critical analysis of strengths and limitations (2 marks)

### Question 13 (14 marks)

**Question:** Discuss the role of international relief organizations in disaster management, including their functions, challenges, and importance in community-based disaster response.

**Model Answer:** International relief organizations play a vital role in disaster management by providing resources, expertise, and coordination that transcends national boundaries, particularly when local and national capacities are overwhelmed.

**Functions of International Relief Organizations:**

**Emergency Response and Relief** - Organizations like the Red Cross/Red Crescent, UNICEF, and World Food Programme provide immediate humanitarian assistance including food, water, shelter, medical care, and essential supplies to affected populations. They deploy rapid response teams with specialized expertise in areas like search and rescue, medical emergency care, and logistics management.

**Capacity Building and Technical Support** - International organizations transfer knowledge, technology, and best practices to local communities and national agencies. They conduct training programs for local disaster management personnel, establish early warning systems, and help develop disaster preparedness plans tailored to local contexts.

**Coordination and Resource Mobilization** - They facilitate coordination among multiple actors including governments, NGOs, UN agencies, and private sector entities. Organizations like OCHA (Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) ensure efficient resource allocation and prevent duplication of efforts. They also mobilize international funding and resources through appeals and fundraising campaigns.

**Advocacy and Policy Development** - International organizations advocate for vulnerable populations, promote disaster risk reduction policies, and work with governments to strengthen legal and institutional frameworks for disaster management. They bring global attention to disasters and push for sustained commitment to recovery and resilience-building.

**Challenges Faced:**

**Coordination Difficulties** - With multiple international organizations responding to the same disaster, coordination becomes complex. Different mandates, operational procedures, and priorities can lead to inefficiencies, gaps in coverage, or duplication of services.

**Cultural and Linguistic Barriers** - International responders may face challenges understanding local customs, languages, and social structures, potentially leading to culturally inappropriate interventions or miscommunication with affected communities.

**Resource Constraints and Competing Priorities** - Limited funding and numerous simultaneous crises globally force organizations to prioritize, potentially leaving some disasters under-resourced. Media attention often drives funding, creating disparities between "forgotten crises" and high-profile disasters.

**Security and Access Issues** - In conflict zones or politically unstable areas, international organizations face security threats and access restrictions that limit their ability to reach affected populations. Political tensions between host governments and international agencies can also impede operations.

**Sustainability and Dependency Concerns** - Over-reliance on international aid can create dependency and undermine local capacity development. The transition from emergency response to long-term recovery and the eventual exit of international organizations must be carefully managed to ensure sustainability.

**Importance in Community-Based Disaster Response:**

International relief organizations increasingly recognize that effective disaster response must be community-driven. They work to empower local communities by:
- Supporting community-based early warning systems and evacuation plans
- Training local volunteers and community leaders in disaster response
- Respecting and incorporating local knowledge and traditional coping mechanisms
- Ensuring that aid distribution and recovery programs are designed with community participation
- Linking international resources with local organizations and grassroots initiatives

By combining international expertise and resources with local knowledge and ownership, these organizations help build resilient communities capable of preparing for, responding to, and recovering from disasters more effectively. The partnership between international organizations and local communities creates a multiplier effect, extending the reach and sustainability of disaster management efforts while ensuring culturally appropriate and contextually relevant interventions.

**Keywords:** Humanitarian assistance, capacity building, coordination mechanisms, cultural sensitivity, community empowerment, sustainability.

### Question 14 (14 marks)

**Question:** Explain the concepts of structural and non-structural measures in disaster risk reduction. Provide detailed examples for flood risk reduction and discuss their effectiveness.

**Model Answer:** Disaster risk reduction employs both structural and non-structural measures to minimize the impact of hazards on communities. Understanding the distinction, application, and effectiveness of both approaches is crucial for comprehensive disaster management.

**Structural Measures:**

Structural measures involve engineered solutions and physical infrastructure designed to reduce disaster impacts through controlling, modifying, or resisting hazard forces. These are tangible, visible interventions that directly interact with hazards.

**Flood Risk Reduction - Structural Measures:**

**Storage Reservoirs and Dams** - These structures capture and retain floodwaters upstream, controlling release rates to prevent downstream flooding. Reservoirs also provide water storage for dry periods, irrigation, and hydroelectric power generation. However, they require significant investment, can displace communities, alter ecosystems, and pose risks if they fail.

**Levees and Floodwalls** - Embankments constructed along riverbanks confine floodwaters within designated channels, protecting adjacent areas from inundation. While effective for moderate floods, they can create a false sense of security, encourage development in flood-prone areas, and catastrophically fail during extreme events, potentially worsening impacts.

**Channel Improvement and River Training** - Widening, deepening, or straightening river channels increases their capacity to carry floodwaters without overflowing. River training works like groynes and revetments stabilize riverbanks and control flow direction. These modifications can increase downstream flood risk by accelerating water movement and may damage aquatic ecosystems.

**Retarding Basins** - Specially designed low-lying areas temporarily store floodwaters during peak flows, releasing them gradually after flood peaks pass. These are particularly effective in urban areas where they can be integrated into parks or recreational spaces, serving multiple purposes.

**Coastal Embankments** - In coastal areas, seawalls and embankments protect against storm surges and coastal flooding. Examples include the extensive coastal embankment systems in the Netherlands and Bangladesh. They are expensive to build and maintain and can accelerate coastal erosion and damage marine ecosystems.

**Non-Structural Measures:**

Non-structural measures encompass policies, awareness, knowledge development, public commitment, and methods that reduce disaster risk without requiring large-scale engineering. These focus on reducing exposure and vulnerability through social and behavioral changes.

**Flood Risk Reduction - Non-Structural Measures:**

**Hazard Mapping and Risk Assessment** - Identifying flood-prone areas through scientific analysis and mapping allows informed decision-making. Maps show flood zones with different return periods (10-year, 100-year floods), enabling targeted interventions.

**Land Use Regulations and Zoning** - Prohibiting or restricting development in high-risk flood zones prevents exposure of people and assets. Zoning ordinances can designate floodplains for agriculture, parks, or other compatible uses while keeping residential and critical infrastructure in safer areas.

**Building Codes and Standards** - Regulations requiring elevated foundations, flood-resistant materials, and proper drainage in flood-prone areas reduce damage when flooding occurs. Standards ensure new construction can withstand expected flood levels.

**Early Warning Systems** - Real-time monitoring of rainfall, river levels, and weather patterns combined with communication networks provides advance warning, enabling evacuation and protective actions. Systems integrate meteorological data, hydrological models, and dissemination channels.

**Public Awareness and Education** - Training communities about flood risks, evacuation procedures, and protective measures builds preparedness. Education programs teach recognition of warning signs, family emergency planning, and appropriate response actions.

**Flood Insurance and Financial Mechanisms** - Insurance programs transfer financial risk, provide compensation for losses, and incentivize risk reduction measures through premium structures. However, they must be affordable and accessible to be effective.

**Floodplain Restoration** - Restoring natural floodplains, wetlands, and forests enhances natural water absorption and retention, reducing downstream flood peaks while providing ecosystem benefits. This nature-based solution combines disaster risk reduction with environmental conservation.

**Emergency Preparedness Planning** - Developing evacuation routes, shelter locations, stockpiling supplies, and conducting drills ensures effective response when floods occur. Plans identify vulnerable populations requiring special assistance and establish coordination mechanisms.

**Effectiveness and Integration:**

Structural measures provide immediate, visible protection and are psychologically reassuring. However, they have limitations:
- High costs of construction and maintenance
- Environmental impacts and ecosystem disruption
- Can fail catastrophically during extreme events exceeding design capacity
- May create complacency and encourage risky development
- Fixed protection levels that may become inadequate with changing climate

Non-structural measures are generally more cost-effective, flexible, and sustainable:
- Lower implementation costs
- Address root causes of vulnerability
- Enhance community capacity and resilience
- Adaptable to changing conditions
- Minimal environmental damage

Most effective disaster risk reduction combines both approaches. For example, a comprehensive flood management strategy might include:
- Structural: Strategic levees protecting critical infrastructure and urban centers
- Non-structural: Zoning to prevent development in extreme flood zones, early warning systems, community preparedness programs, and wetland restoration

The integration ensures multiple layers of protection—structural measures provide physical barriers while non-structural measures reduce exposure, enhance preparedness, and build adaptive capacity. This layered approach acknowledges that no single measure is foolproof and that disasters exceeding structural protection capacity still require prepared, resilient communities capable of effective response and recovery.

**Keywords:** Engineered solutions, infrastructure, policy measures, land-use planning, early warnings, integrated approach, resilience.

**Marking Scheme Breakdown:**
- Clear explanation of structural measures with flood examples (4 marks)
- Clear explanation of non-structural measures with flood examples (4 marks)
- Discussion of effectiveness of both approaches (3 marks)
- Analysis of integrated approach and complementarity (3 marks)

### Question 15 (14 marks)

**Question:** Discuss the process of capacity assessment and capacity building for disaster management. Explain why assessing capacity is important and describe methods for strengthening capacity for reducing disaster risk.

**Model Answer:** Capacity assessment and capacity building are foundational elements of effective disaster risk management, enabling communities, institutions, and systems to prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters more effectively.

**Capacity Assessment:**

A capacity assessment is an analysis of desired capacities against existing capacities, generating an understanding of capacity assets and needs that informs capacity development strategies. It examines the abilities, resources, relationships, and knowledge that individuals, organizations, and communities possess to manage disaster risks.

**Why Assessing Capacity is Important:**

**Informs Strategic Planning** - Capacity assessment provides baseline data on strengths and gaps, enabling evidence-based planning of interventions. It helps determine realistic goals and appropriate support strategies based on actual conditions rather than assumptions.

**Optimizes Resource Allocation** - Understanding existing capacities prevents duplication of efforts and wasteful spending. Assessment identifies where investments will have the greatest impact, ensuring efficient use of limited resources in disaster-prone areas.

**Determines Feasibility of Aid** - Assessment helps development partners decide if and how to support capacity development. Weak capacity may indicate that fewer funds can be effectively absorbed initially and that more foundational capacity building is required before implementing complex programs.

**Supports Policy Dialogue** - Assessment results provide objective data for discussions between governments, communities, and development partners about priorities, timelines, and responsibilities. They can identify systemic issues requiring policy reforms or institutional changes.

**Establishes Monitoring Baselines** - Initial assessments create benchmarks against which progress can be measured over time, enabling adaptive management and demonstrating impact to stakeholders and funders.

**How to Assess Capacity:**

**Self-Assessment Approach** - Partner-led assessments engaging organizational staff foster ownership and buy-in to subsequent capacity development processes. Self-assessments are more sustainable than external assessments as they build internal reflection and analysis capabilities. However, they may lack objectivity or technical rigor without external facilitation.

**Participatory Methods** - Including diverse stakeholders—frontline responders, community members, technical experts, government officials—ensures comprehensive understanding of capacity across systems. Participatory approaches capture tacit knowledge and local perspectives often missed by external consultants.

**Avoid Gap-Focused Models** - Assessments should identify existing capacity assets and strengths, not only deficiencies. Asset-based approaches recognize capacities that already work and can be enhanced, rather than imposing external "best practice" models that may not fit local contexts.

**System-Wide Perspective** - Looking beyond single organizations to examine how multiple actors interact is crucial, especially in sector-wide approaches. Capacity of frontline service providers, oversight institutions, cross-cutting coordinating bodies, and non-state actors all shape disaster management outcomes.

**Multiple Dimensions** - Comprehensive capacity assessment examines:
- **Human resources**: Skills, knowledge, and training of personnel
- **Organizational capacity**: Structures, systems, and management processes
- **Institutional environment**: Policies, laws, regulations, and inter-organizational relationships
- **Financial resources**: Funding availability and financial management systems
- **Physical infrastructure**: Equipment, facilities, and technology
- **Information and knowledge**: Data systems, research capacity, and information sharing

**Strengthening Capacity for Disaster Risk Reduction:**

The United Nations Development Programme and other agencies have developed comprehensive approaches to strengthen disaster risk management capacities:

**1. Capacity Building for Disaster Management Systems:**

**Institutional Strengthening** - Enhancing disaster management authorities by improving organizational structures, defining clear roles and responsibilities, ensuring adequate staffing and funding, and establishing effective coordination mechanisms with other agencies. This includes setting up functional Emergency Operations Centers with trained personnel and regular drills.

**Legal and Policy Framework Development** - Establishing or updating disaster management legislation, policies, and plans that clarify mandates, allocate resources, and create accountability structures. This includes integrating disaster risk reduction into development planning at all levels.

**Disaster Response Force Enhancement** - Training and equipping specialized teams for search and rescue, medical emergency response, hazardous materials handling, and other technical functions. This involves regular exercises, appropriate equipment, and clearly defined standard operating procedures.

**Decision Support Systems** - Developing technological platforms that integrate and analyze information from multiple sources (meteorological, seismological, demographic, infrastructure) in geo-spatial systems. These systems enable evidence-based decision-making during preparedness and response phases.

**2. Technical Support for Risk Reduction and Response Preparedness:**

**Hydro-Meteorological Resilience Planning** - Analyzing extreme weather event patterns, developing resilience solutions tailored to local conditions, and establishing robust, fail-safe early warning systems. This includes upgrading monitoring networks, improving forecasting capabilities, and ensuring warnings reach all at-risk populations through multiple channels.

**Vulnerability Assessments** - Conducting detailed analyses of exposure and vulnerability with specific focus on relevant hazards (floods, earthquakes, cyclones). Urban vulnerability assessments examine building stock, critical infrastructure, and population concentrations to identify priority areas for mitigation.

**Design Guidelines and Standards** - Updating construction codes and material specifications to align with national and international best practices, particularly for seismic, wind, and flood resistance. This includes training architects, engineers, and building inspectors on updated standards.

**Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance** - Developing mechanisms to secure cost-effective access
