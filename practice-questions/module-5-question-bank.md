### Question 13 (14 marks)

**Question:** Discuss Priority 3 of the Sendai Framework: Investing in Disaster Risk Reduction for Resilience. Explain how this priority can be implemented in India.

**Model Answer:** Priority 3 of the Sendai Framework emphasizes that investing in disaster risk reduction is not an optional expenditure but a necessary investment that yields substantial returns by preventing losses, protecting development gains, and building resilient societies and economies.

**Understanding Investment in DRR:**

Investing in disaster risk reduction means allocating public and private resources to structural and non-structural measures that prevent new risks, reduce existing risks, and enhance resilience. This investment spans physical infrastructure, ecosystems, health, education, technology, and institutional capacity, recognizing that comprehensive resilience requires multi-sectoral approaches.

**Key Investment Areas:**

**Health and Education Resilience:**

**Health Infrastructure** - Strengthening healthcare facilities to withstand disasters and continue functioning during emergencies. Hospitals in earthquake or cyclone-prone areas must meet structural safety standards. Building surge capacity to handle mass casualties, establishing medical supply stockpiles, and training health workers in disaster medicine are critical investments.

**School Safety** - Ensuring that school buildings meet safety standards and retrofitting vulnerable schools. Beyond physical safety, integrating disaster risk reduction in curricula teaches children life-saving knowledge and behaviors. Safe schools also serve as community shelters during disasters.

**Public Health Programs** - Investing in disease surveillance, vector control, water and sanitation infrastructure, and immunization programs that prevent disease outbreaks which often follow disasters.

**Economic and Productive Sector Resilience:**

**Business Continuity** - Supporting businesses, especially small and medium enterprises, to develop business continuity plans, maintain insurance coverage, and adopt risk reduction measures. Economic shocks from disasters can bankrupt businesses, causing unemployment and economic recession.

**Livelihood Protection** - Investing in livelihood diversification for vulnerable communities, agricultural insurance, drought-resistant crops, and post-disaster livelihood restoration programs ensures that disasters don't push people into poverty.

**Financial Instruments** - Developing disaster risk financing mechanisms including catastrophe bonds, insurance pools, contingency funds, and social protection systems that provide rapid financial assistance to affected populations and governments.

**Infrastructure and Environmental Resilience:**

**Resilient Infrastructure** - Incorporating disaster resilience in design and construction of roads, bridges, power systems, communication networks, water supply, and drainage systems. Multi-hazard resistant infrastructure costs marginally more initially but saves enormously in avoided damage and disruption.

**Ecosystem-Based Approaches** - Investing in ecosystem restoration and conservation provides natural disaster protection. Coastal mangroves reduce storm surge impacts, forests prevent landslides and regulate water flows, wetlands absorb floodwaters. These nature-based solutions provide co-benefits of biodiversity conservation and climate adaptation.

**Urban Planning** - Investing in planned urban development with adequate open spaces, drainage systems, building regulations, and land-use zoning prevents creation of new risks in rapidly urbanizing areas.

**Technology and Innovation:**

**Early Warning Systems** - Investing in meteorological infrastructure, seismic networks, communication systems, and warning dissemination channels saves lives by providing advance notice of impending disasters.

**Digital Technologies** - Leveraging remote sensing, GIS, artificial intelligence, and mobile technologies for risk mapping, monitoring, rapid damage assessment, and coordination enhances disaster management efficiency.

**Research and Development** - Investing in research on disaster-resistant technologies, risk modeling, forecasting methods, and resilience-building measures generates new knowledge that improves disaster management practice.

**Implementation in India:**

India can implement Priority 3 through:

**National Disaster Mitigation Fund** - Currently, National Disaster Response Fund focuses on relief. Creating a dedicated mitigation fund for pre-disaster investments in risk reduction infrastructure, ecosystem restoration, and community resilience programs would institutionalize DRR investment.

**Mainstreaming in Development Programs** - Integrating disaster resilience in flagship programs like Smart Cities, AMRUT, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, MGNREGA, and National Rural Livelihood Mission ensures disaster considerations shape development investments rather than being afterthoughts.

**Public-Private Partnerships** - Creating incentive mechanisms for private sector investment in disaster resilience—tax benefits for resilient construction, insurance premium reductions for risk reduction measures, CSR funding for community resilience projects, and PPP models for resilient infrastructure.

**Building Code Enforcement** - Strengthening enforcement of building codes through penalties, third-party audits, and public disclosure of compliance ensures that construction investments incorporate seismic, wind, and flood resistance.

**Ecosystem Restoration Programs** - Expanding programs like Coastal Regulation Zone management, watershed development, afforestation, and wetland conservation that provide natural disaster protection alongside environmental benefits.

**Urban Resilience Programs** - Investing in comprehensive urban disaster risk assessments, upgrading drainage systems, creating flood retention basins, improving solid waste management, and relocating settlements from high-risk zones in major cities.

**Agricultural Risk Management** - Expanding crop insurance coverage, promoting climate-resilient agriculture, developing drought-resistant varieties, improving irrigation efficiency, and diversifying rural livelihoods reduces agricultural vulnerability.

**Returns on Investment:**

Studies show that every dollar invested in disaster risk reduction saves between $4-7 in disaster response and recovery costs. In India's context, investing in cyclone shelters in coastal areas has demonstrably saved thousands of lives. Earthquake-resistant construction costs 5-10% more but prevents catastrophic losses. Ecosystem-based approaches like mangrove restoration provide protection at fraction of cost of sea walls while delivering multiple co-benefits.

However, DRR investment faces challenges of competing priorities, short-term budget cycles that prioritize immediate needs over long-term investments, difficulty in measuring returns from disasters prevented, and capacity constraints in implementing complex resilience projects. Overcoming these requires political commitment, innovative financing, robust monitoring of resilience outcomes, and demonstrating cost-effectiveness of prevention over post-disaster response.

Priority 3 recognizes that building resilience requires sustained investment across all sectors and levels, transforming disaster risk reduction from expense line to strategic investment in sustainable development and prosperity.

### Question 14 (14 marks)

**Question:** Explain the concept of the National Executive Committee (NEC) in India's disaster management framework and discuss the coordination mechanisms between national, state, and district levels.

**Model Answer:** The National Executive Committee (NEC) represents the executive and coordinating body in India's disaster management architecture, bridging policy formulation at the NDMA level with ground-level implementation through states and districts.

**National Executive Committee (NEC):**

**Constitution and Composition:**

The NEC is constituted under Section 8 of the Disaster Management Act 2005 to assist the NDMA in implementation of policies and plans. It is headed by the Union Home Secretary (who serves as ex-officio Chairperson) and comprises Secretaries of key ministries and departments including Agriculture, Atomic Energy, Defence, Drinking Water and Sanitation, Environment, Finance, Health, Power, Rural Development, Science and Technology, Telecommunications, Urban Development, and Water Resources. Chief of the Integrated Defence Staff, representatives from state governments, and experts can be co-opted as needed.

**Functions and Responsibilities:**

**Plan Implementation** - NEC prepares the National Plan in accordance with guidelines laid down by NDMA, coordinating inputs from ministries, states, and expert bodies. It monitors implementation of national and state plans, ensuring timely execution of preparedness and mitigation measures.

**Inter-Ministerial Coordination** - NEC coordinates disaster management activities across central government ministries and departments, ensuring integrated approach rather than siloed functioning. It resolves inter-ministerial issues and facilitates resource sharing.

**State Coordination** - NEC maintains liaison with State Disaster Management Authorities, providing technical support, sharing best practices, and facilitating interstate cooperation during disasters affecting multiple states.

**Resource Mobilization** - NEC ensures availability of resources for disaster management including financial, human, and material resources. It coordinates deployment of central resources to states during disasters.

**Guideline Implementation** - NEC oversees implementation of guidelines issued by NDMA across sectors and levels, ensuring standardization of approaches while allowing contextual adaptation.

**Emergency Response Coordination** - During major disasters, NEC functions as the apex coordination body, bringing together representatives of affected ministries and states to ensure coordinated emergency response.

**Review and Monitoring** - NEC conducts periodic reviews of disaster preparedness, analyzes response to disasters, and recommends corrective measures for improving disaster management effectiveness.

**Coordination Mechanisms:**

**Vertical Coordination (National-State-District):**

**Policy Cascade** - Policies and guidelines formulated by NDMA flow down through state governments to district administrations. NDMA provides broad policy framework, SDMAs adapt it to state context, and DDMAs implement it considering local conditions.

**Plan Hierarchy** - National Disaster Management Plan provides overarching framework, State Plans detail state-specific strategies aligning with national plan, and District Plans operationalize these strategies at local level with specific action points, resources, and timelines.

**Information Flow** - Information flows both top-down (policies, warnings, guidelines, resource allocation) and bottom-up (ground situation reports, resource requirements, implementation challenges, lessons learned). Real-time information systems enable this bi-directional flow during emergencies.

**Resource Deployment** - When district resources are insufficient, DDMAs request state support; when state capacity is overwhelmed, SDMAs request central assistance through established protocols. This layered response ensures appropriate level response while preventing unnecessary deployment of higher-level resources.

**Capacity Building Cascade** - NDMA and NIDM train master trainers from states, who in turn train district officials and community volunteers, creating cascading capacity building that reaches grassroots while maintaining quality through standard training modules.

**Horizontal Coordination (Across Departments):**

**Sector Integration** - Disasters require coordinated response from multiple sectors—health, water, power, telecommunications, transport, police, fire services, revenue administration. Emergency Operation Centers at national, state, and district levels serve as coordination hubs bringing these sectors together.

**Incident Response System** - India has adopted Incident Response System (IRS) that clearly defines roles and responsibilities of different agencies during disasters, establishes command structures, and provides standard operating procedures for coordination.

**Joint Planning Exercises** - Regular simulation exercises and mock drills involving multiple departments at all levels build coordination capabilities, test communication systems, and identify gaps in coordination mechanisms.

**Inter-State Coordination:**

**Regional Coordination** - For disasters affecting multiple states (floods in river basins, cyclones affecting coastal states), NDMA and NEC facilitate inter-state coordination, ensuring harmonized response and equitable resource distribution.

**Mutual Aid Agreements** - States enter into mutual aid agreements facilitated by NDMA for sharing specialized resources like search and rescue teams, medical facilities, and equipment during disasters.

**Shared River Basin Management** - For floods affecting multiple states, coordination mechanisms involve states both upstream and downstream in early warning, water release management, and evacuation planning.

**Challenges in Coordination:**

Despite well-designed mechanisms, coordination faces challenges:

**Communication Gaps** - During disasters, communication breakdowns due to damaged infrastructure impede coordination. Redundant communication systems and clear protocols are needed.

**Turf Issues** - Overlapping jurisdictions and unclear authority can cause conflicts between agencies. Clear delineation of roles and political commitment to cooperation are essential.

**Capacity Variations** - Varying capacity across states and districts creates imbalances. Better-resourced states can respond effectively while weaker states struggle, requiring continuous capacity building support.

**Time Lag** - Bureaucratic processes can slow coordination. Delegation of powers to field-level officers and pre-disaster agreements expedite response.

**Inadequate Resources** - Insufficient resources at lower levels force frequent upward referrals, overwhelming higher levels. Adequate resource allocation to district and block levels enables local response.

**Strengthening Coordination:**

Enhancing coordination requires: institutionalizing coordination through regular meetings rather than ad-hoc interactions; leveraging technology for real-time information sharing and coordination; conducting joint training and exercises; establishing clear standard operating procedures; creating accountability for coordination failures; and investing in district-level capacity to reduce dependence on higher levels for routine operations.

The National Executive Committee, as the coordinating apex, plays pivotal role in ensuring that India's multi-level, multi-sectoral disaster management architecture functions as an integrated system rather than fragmented pieces. Effective coordination mechanisms transform institutional structures into functional capabilities that save lives and reduce disaster impacts.

### Question 15 (14 marks)

**Question:** Critically analyze India's alignment with the Sendai Framework targets and discuss the challenges and opportunities in achieving these targets by 2030.

**Model Answer:** India, as a signatory to the Sendai Framework, has committed to achieving its seven global targets by 2030. Understanding India's progress, challenges, and opportunities is essential for accelerating disaster risk reduction efforts.

**Sendai Framework Targets and India's Status:**

**Target 1: Substantially Reduce Global Disaster Mortality**

**India's Progress:** India has made significant progress in reducing cyclone-related mortality through early warning systems, cyclone shelters, and evacuation protocols. Deaths from cyclones have reduced dramatically—Cyclone Phailin (2013) caused fewer than 50 deaths despite affecting millions, compared to thousands in past cyclones of similar intensity. However, mortality from earthquakes, floods, and landslides remains substantial.

**Challenges:** High population density in hazard-prone areas, vulnerable housing stock, gaps in early warning coverage for earthquakes and sudden-onset disasters, and inadequate enforcement of building codes in seismic zones continue to pose mortality risks.

**Target 2: Substantially Reduce Number of Affected People**

**India's Progress:** With over 20% of global disaster-affected population, India faces significant challenges. Annual floods, droughts, and extreme weather events affect millions of people, displacing them, destroying livelihoods, and disrupting lives.

**Challenges:** Climate change is increasing frequency and intensity of extreme events; rapid urbanization is concentrating populations in vulnerable areas; agricultural dependence makes large populations vulnerable to droughts and floods; and inadequate social safety nets leave affected populations without adequate support.

**Target 3: Reduce Direct Economic Loss Relative to GDP**

**India's Progress:** Economic losses from disasters are substantial, with some estimates suggesting 2% of GDP annually. However, comprehensive data on economic losses is lacking, making assessment difficult.

**Challenges:** Inadequate insurance penetration means losses are absorbed by individuals and government; informal economy losses are largely undocumented; cascading impacts on livelihoods and businesses extend far beyond direct physical damage; and growing asset values in hazard-prone areas increase exposure.

**Target 4: Substantially Reduce Disaster Damage to Critical Infrastructure**

**India's Progress:** India has developed guidelines for disaster-resilient infrastructure and mainstreaming resilience in infrastructure projects. National Building Code, seismic zonation, and design codes provide standards for resilient construction.

**Challenges:** Large stock of existing vulnerable infrastructure requires retrofitting; enforcement of building codes is weak; rapidly expanding infrastructure in hazard-prone areas creates new vulnerabilities; and balancing cost and resilience in resource-constrained environments is challenging.

**Target 5: Increase Countries with DRR Strategies**

**India's Progress:** India has comprehensive disaster management framework with Disaster Management Act 2005, National Policy 2009, National Plan 2016, and state/district plans. Most states have prepared disaster management plans, though quality and implementation vary.

**Challenges:** Many district plans exist only on paper without adequate resources or implementation mechanisms; plans need regular updating based on changing risk profiles; mainstreaming DRR in development planning remains incomplete; and community-level planning is limited.

**Target 6: Enhance International Cooperation**

**India's Progress:** India actively participates in international disaster management forums, provides assistance to neighboring countries during disasters, shares expertise through training programs, and collaborates with international organizations and bilateral partners.

**Challenges:** Regional cooperation mechanisms need strengthening; knowledge and technology sharing can be expanded; south-south cooperation potential remains underutilized; and balancing domestic priorities with international commitments requires resources.

**Target 7: Increase Access to Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems**

**India's Progress:** India has made substantial investments in early warning systems for cyclones, floods, and tsunamis. India Meteorological Department, Central Water Commission, and INCOIS provide forecasts and warnings. Mobile technology has revolutionized warning dissemination with millions receiving alerts.

**Challenges:** Early warning for earthquakes and landslides remains inadequate; last-mile connectivity to remote and vulnerable communities is weak; warnings don't always translate to action due to trust issues or inadequate response capacity; and multi-hazard integrated early warning systems need development.

**Opportunities for Achieving Targets:**

**Technology Leverage:** India's strength in information technology, remote sensing, and mobile connectivity provides opportunities for developing innovative early warning systems, risk monitoring platforms, and citizen engagement tools that leapfrog traditional approaches.

**Economic Growth:** India's economic growth provides resources for investing in resilient infrastructure, social protection systems, and comprehensive disaster risk reduction programs that were unaffordable in the past.

**Urbanization Management:** While rapid urbanization poses challenges, it also provides opportunity to build new urban areas with integrated disaster resilience from the outset through planned development, resilient design, and enforcement of regulations.

**Policy Frameworks:** Strong legal and institutional frameworks provide foundation for accelerated action. What's needed is effective implementation, adequate resourcing, and accountability mechanisms.

**Community Resilience:** India's strong community structures, social capital, and traditional knowledge provide foundation for community-based disaster risk reduction that complements top-down approaches.

**Youth Engagement:** India's young population, if engaged through school safety programs, volunteer networks, and digital platforms, can become powerful force for building culture of prevention and resilience.

**Green Infrastructure:** Ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction through Coastal Regulation Zone management, watershed development, and urban greening provides cost-effective resilience while delivering climate adaptation and biodiversity co-benefits.

**Critical Success Factors:**

Achieving Sendai targets requires:

**Political Commitment** - Sustained high-level political support for disaster risk reduction, moving it from emergency response domain to core development priority.

**Adequate Resources** - Allocating sufficient financial resources for pre-disaster risk reduction, not just post-disaster relief, including dedicated disaster mitigation funds.

**Data and Evidence** - Strengthening disaster loss databases, conducting rigorous impact assessments, and using evidence to inform policy and investment decisions.

**Multi-Stakeholder Engagement** - Meaningful participation of communities, private sector, civil society, and academia in disaster risk governance and implementation.

**Integration with SDGs** - Recognizing synergies between Sendai Framework and Sustainable Development Goals and pursuing integrated approaches that advance both agendas.

**Innovation and Technology** - Leveraging India's technological capabilities for developing contextually appropriate, scalable solutions for disaster risk reduction.

**Accountability Mechanisms** - Establishing clear indicators, regular monitoring, and accountability for achieving targets at all levels of governance.

While India faces significant challenges in achieving Sendai targets given its large vulnerable population, diverse hazards, and developmental pressures, it also possesses strong frameworks, growing resources, and innovative capabilities. Success will depend on political will to prioritize prevention over response, sustained investment in risk reduction, effective implementation of existing policies and plans, and genuine partnership between government, communities, and other stakeholders. The journey toward Sendai targets is also journey toward more sustainable, equitable, and resilient development model for India.
