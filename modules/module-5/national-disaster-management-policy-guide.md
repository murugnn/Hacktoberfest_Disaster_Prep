# National Policy on Disaster Management 2009: A Comprehensive Study Guide

## 1. Background and Context

The National Policy on Disaster Management (NPDM) was prepared in accordance with the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and provides a comprehensive framework for handling disasters in a holistic manner. Prior to this policy, India's disaster management approach was predominantly reactive and relief-centric, focusing primarily on post-disaster response rather than prevention and mitigation.

The enactment of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, marked a watershed moment in India's approach to disaster management. The Act was notified in the Gazette of India on December 26, 2005, providing the legal and institutional framework for effective management of disasters. The NPDM, adopted in 2009, operationalized this legislative framework and established clear policy directions.

The Policy covers all aspects of disaster management including institutional, legal and financial arrangements; disaster prevention, mitigation and preparedness, techno-legal regime; response, relief and rehabilitation; reconstruction and recovery; capacity development; knowledge management and research and development. It addresses the concerns of all sections of society including differently abled persons, women, children and other disadvantaged groups.

## 2. Vision Statement of the Policy

The vision of the National Policy on Disaster Management aims to build a safe and disaster resilient India by developing a holistic, proactive, multi-disaster oriented and technology driven strategy through a culture of prevention, mitigation, preparedness and response.

This vision represents a fundamental paradigm shift from the traditional reactive approach to a proactive strategy that emphasizes disaster risk reduction. The policy envisions creating a disaster-resilient nation where communities are prepared, institutions are strengthened, and development planning integrates disaster management considerations at every level.

## 3. Key Objectives

The NPDM articulates a comprehensive set of objectives that guide India's disaster management efforts:

## 5. Paradigm Shift: From Relief to Prevention

The NPDM represents a fundamental transformation in India's disaster management philosophy. Historically, disaster management in India was largely relief-centric, focusing on post-disaster response and rehabilitation. The 2009 policy marks a decisive shift toward a more comprehensive approach.

### Key Elements of the Paradigm Shift:

**From Reactive to Proactive:** The policy emphasizes anticipating disasters and taking preventive measures rather than merely responding after disasters strike. This involves risk assessment, hazard mapping, and early warning systems.

**Prevention and Mitigation Priority:** Rather than accepting disasters as inevitable, the policy prioritizes reducing disaster risks through structural and non-structural mitigation measures. This includes enforcing building codes, land-use planning, and ecosystem-based approaches.

**Pre-Disaster Preparedness:** Extensive emphasis is placed on preparedness measures including training, mock drills, contingency planning, and pre-positioning of resources. Communities and institutions are prepared to respond effectively when disasters occur.

**Integration with Development:** Disaster management is no longer viewed as a standalone activity but is integrated into development planning. Development projects are required to consider disaster risks and incorporate mitigation measures.

**Long-term Resilience Building:** The focus extends beyond immediate relief to building long-term resilience of communities, infrastructure, and systems. This involves strengthening livelihoods, social cohesion, and institutional capacities.

**Comprehensive Risk Management:** The policy addresses the entire disaster management cycle—prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response, recovery, and reconstruction—rather than focusing solely on relief operations.

## 6. Institutional Mechanisms

The Disaster Management Act, 2005 mandates creation of new institutions and assignment of specific roles for Central, State and Local Governments.
