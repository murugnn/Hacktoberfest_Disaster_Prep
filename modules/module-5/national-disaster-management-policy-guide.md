## 1. Background and Context

The National Policy on Disaster Management (NPDM) was prepared in accordance with the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and provides a comprehensive framework for handling disasters in a holistic manner. Prior to this policy, India's disaster management approach was predominantly reactive and relief-centric, focusing primarily on post-disaster response rather than prevention and mitigation.

The enactment of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, marked a watershed moment in India's approach to disaster management. The Act was notified in the Gazette of India on December 26, 2005, providing the legal and institutional framework for effective management of disasters. The NPDM, adopted in 2009, operationalized this legislative framework and established clear policy directions.

The Policy covers all aspects of disaster management including institutional, legal and financial arrangements; disaster prevention, mitigation and preparedness, techno-legal regime; response, relief and rehabilitation; reconstruction and recovery; capacity development; knowledge management and research and development. It addresses the concerns of all sections of society including differently abled persons, women, children and other disadvantaged groups.

## 2. Vision Statement of the Policy

The vision of the National Policy on Disaster Management aims to build a safe and disaster resilient India by developing a holistic, proactive, multi-disaster oriented and technology driven strategy through a culture of prevention, mitigation, preparedness and response.

This vision represents a fundamental paradigm shift from the traditional reactive approach to a proactive strategy that emphasizes disaster risk reduction. The policy envisions creating a disaster-resilient nation where communities are prepared, institutions are strengthened, and development planning integrates disaster management considerations at every level.

## 3. Key Objectives

The NPDM articulates a comprehensive set of objectives that guide India's disaster management efforts:

### 3.1 Promoting Culture of Prevention and Resilience
The policy aims to promote a culture of prevention, preparedness and resilience at all levels through knowledge, innovation and education. This objective emphasizes moving away from a reactive mindset to one that prioritizes anticipating and preventing disasters before they occur.

### 4.9 Financial Mechanisms
The policy establishes comprehensive financial arrangements to ensure adequate resources for all phases of disaster management:

**National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF):**
- Managed by the Central Government at the national level
- Used for meeting expenses for emergency response, relief, and rehabilitation
- Funded through budgetary allocations and voluntary contributions
- Utilized for disasters of severe nature requiring central assistance

**State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF):**
- Constituted in each state as the primary fund for state-level disaster response
- Funded through cost-sharing between Centre and States:
  - General category states: 75% Central contribution, 25% State contribution
  - Special category states (NE and Himalayan states): 90% Central, 10% State
- Used for immediate relief measures as per approved norms
- Annual allocation based on Finance Commission recommendations

**National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF):**
- Focuses on mitigation and preparedness projects
- Supports structural mitigation (retrofitting, cyclone shelters) and non-structural measures (capacity building, awareness programs)
- Encourages proactive investment in risk reduction
- Emphasizes the principle that "prevention is better and cheaper than cure"

This three-tier financial architecture ensures resources are available for both immediate response and long-term risk reduction.

### 4.10 Knowledge Management
Systematic documentation, research, and knowledge sharing are prioritized to build a strong evidence base for disaster management decisions and continuous learning.

## 5. Paradigm Shift: From Relief to Prevention

The NPDM represents a fundamental transformation in India's disaster management philosophy. Historically, disaster management in India was largely relief-centric, focusing on post-disaster response and rehabilitation. The 2009 policy marks a decisive shift toward a more comprehensive approach.

### Key Elements of the Paradigm Shift:

**From Reactive to Proactive:** The policy emphasizes anticipating disasters and taking preventive measures rather than merely responding after disasters strike. This involves risk assessment, hazard mapping, and early warning systems.

**Prevention and Mitigation Priority:** Rather than accepting disasters as inevitable, the policy prioritizes reducing disaster risks through structural and non-structural mitigation measures. This includes enforcing building codes, land-use planning, and ecosystem-based approaches.

**Pre-Disaster Preparedness:** Extensive emphasis is placed on preparedness measures including training, mock drills, contingency planning, and pre-positioning of resources. Communities and institutions are prepared to respond effectively when disasters occur.

**Integration with Development:** Disaster management is no longer viewed as a standalone activity but is integrated into development planning. Development projects are required to consider disaster risks and incorporate mitigation measures.

**Long-term Resilience Building:** The focus extends beyond immediate relief to building long-term resilience of communities, infrastructure, and systems. This involves strengthening livelihoods, social cohesion, and institutional capacities.

**Comprehensive Risk Management:** The policy addresses the entire disaster management cycleâ€”prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response, recovery, and reconstructionâ€”rather than focusing solely on relief operations.

### Practical Demonstration of the Paradigm Shift

The transformation from relief-centric to prevention-focused approach is evident in India's handling of major disasters:

**Cyclone Management Evolution:**
- **Pre-2009 Approach:** Odisha Super Cyclone (1999) caused 10,000+ deaths; focus was primarily on post-cyclone relief distribution and rehabilitation
- **Post-2009 Approach:** 
  - 72-hour advance warnings through India Meteorological Department (IMD)
  - Mass evacuations based on risk assessment (1.2 million people evacuated during Cyclone Fani, 2019)
  - Network of cyclone shelters constructed in coastal areas
  - Community-based early warning dissemination systems
  - **Result:** Despite facing intense cyclones like Phailin (2013) and Fani (2019), casualties reduced to double digits from thousands

**Earthquake Preparedness:**
- **Pre-2009:** Gujarat Earthquake (2001) resulted in 20,000+ deaths; response was primarily post-disaster rescue and relief
- **Post-2009:**
  - Comprehensive seismic zone mapping across the country completed
  - Building code enforcement strengthened in vulnerable areas
  - Regular mock drills conducted in schools, offices, and communities in seismic zones
  - Public awareness campaigns on "Drop, Cover, and Hold" protocols
  - Retrofitting of critical infrastructure and lifeline buildings
  - **Impact:** Enhanced preparedness and resilience in earthquake-prone regions

**Flood Management:**
- **Traditional Approach:** Reactive response after floods occurred, focus on relief camps and compensation
- **Contemporary Approach:**
  - Real-time flood forecasting systems with 24-48 hour lead time
  - Flood hazard mapping and vulnerability assessment
  - Early warning dissemination through multiple channels including mobile alerts
  - Identification and preparation of evacuation routes and temporary shelters
  - Community training on flood preparedness and response
  - **Example:** During Kerala Floods (2018), despite unprecedented rainfall, early warnings and coordinated evacuation saved countless lives

These examples demonstrate how the policy's emphasis on prevention, preparedness, and early warning has translated into tangible reduction in disaster casualties and more effective disaster management.

## 6. Institutional Mechanisms
